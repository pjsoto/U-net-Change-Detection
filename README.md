# U-net-Change-Detection-Classifier
The current project contains the scripts to perform a change detection classification for remote sensing data, specifically for deforestation detection in two Brazilian biomes,
Amazon rainforest(Brazilian Legal Amazon) and Brazilian savannah (Cerrado). Regarding the U-net architectured used here, we follow the structure of the one proposed in [1] but  adapting the current to the conditions of our datasets by using a different size of samples at the input of the network.
